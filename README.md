# Essential JS 1 and Essential JS 2 with angular

This repository demonstrates how to integrate Syncfusion Essential JS 1 (EJ1) components into an Angular application that already uses Essential JS 2 (EJ2) components. This compatibility approach is useful for developers who are migrating from EJ1 to EJ2 but still need to support legacy components during the transition.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Angular CLI (npm install -g @angular/cli)

### Step: 1

Use the following command to install the dependent npm packages from the command prompt.

`npm install`

### Step: 2

Run the application by using following command:

`npm run start`

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Step: 3

Build the application for production by using following command:

`npm run build`
